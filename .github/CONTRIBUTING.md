# Contributing

If you're reading this, it means you want to contribute to this project. Hooray!

Here's what to do:

1. If you're looking for a task to work on, check the
   ["up-for-grabs" issues](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends/labels/upforgrabs). If you see something there that catches your
   eye, leave a comment indicating you'll work on it and
   it's yours! If you already have something to work on,
   that's great as well!
2. Fork the repository (https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends/fork).
3. Clone your forked repository.
4. From within the repository directory, run
   `bundle install` to install all dependencies needed for development.
5. Create your feature branch
   (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
6. Make your changes. Add or modify tests if necessary!
   (Run tests with `bundle exec rake test`.) Do your best to conform to
   existing style and commenting patterns. You can run the local version of the
   `friends` script with `bundle exec bin/friends`.
7. Update the `README.md` as necessary to include your changes.
8. Check your changes for code style by running `bundle exec rubocop .` in
   the repository directory. You may see output indicating that some lines
   differ from the style guidelines. Change your code so that Rubocop gives
   no warnings or errors (and don't hesitate to reach out if you don't know how!‚Äîthis practice is meant to keep the code clean but it shouldn't be
   scary and it's totally fine to need help!).
9. Commit your changes
   (`git commit -am "Add some feature"`).
10. Push your changes to GitHub, and open a pull request.
11. Your code will be reviewed and merged as quickly as
    possible!
12. Check yourself out on the [contributors page](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends/graphs/contributors)! Look at how cool you are!

If you have any questions at all or get stuck on any step,
don't hesitate to
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends/issues/new)!
I'll respond as quickly as I can, and I'm friendly! I
promise I don't bite. üòä
