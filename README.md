## Overview

`friends` is a command-line program that helps you to keep track of your relationships with the
people you care about.

`friends` gives you:
- More organization around staying in touch with friends and
  family.
- A way to track the ebbs and flows of your relationships over
  time.
- Suggestions for who to call or hang out with when you have free
  time, whether it's fifteen minutes or an entire weekend.
- A low-cost way to record and remember big moments in your life.

Its philosophy emphasizes:

- **Simplicity**—it should be quick and easy to use.
- **Transparency**—all data is stored in a human-readable Markdown file. No
  proprietary formats here! And in addition to being open-source, `friends` is
  very much open to new ideas. Contribute!
- **Intelligence**—specify dates with English phrases like "yesterday." Specify
  friends with their first names, even when you're friends with many *Joanne*s. `friends` will figure it out.

## Installation

```
$ gem install friends
```

Easy, huh?

## Usage

### Core concepts

`friends` is structured around several different types of things:

- **Activities**: The things you do. Each activity has a date associated with
  it. Activities may optionally contain any number of *friends*, *locations*,
  and *tags*.
- **Friends**: The people you do *activities* with. Each friend has a name and,
  optionally, one or several nicknames. (Examples: `John`, `Grace Hopper`)
- **Locations**: The places in which *activities* happen. (Examples: `Paris`,
  `Marie's Diner`)
- **Tags**: A way to categorize your *activities* with tags of your
  choosing. (Examples: `@exercise`, `@school`)

The `friends.md` Markdown file that stores all of your data contains:

- an alphabetical list of all locations:

```markdown
### Locations:
- Atlantis
- Marie's Diner
- Paris
```

- an alphabetical list of all friends and their nicknames and locations:

```markdown
### Friends:
- George Washington Carver
- Grace Hopper (a.k.a. The Admiral a.k.a. Amazing Grace) [Paris]
- Marie Curie [Atlantis]
```

- and an ordered list of all activities:

```markdown
### Activities:
- 2015-11-01: **Grace Hopper** and I went to _Marie's Diner_. George had to cancel at the last minute.
- 2015-01-04: Got lunch with **Grace Hopper** and **George Washington Carver**.
- 2014-12-31: Celebrated the new year in _Paris_ with **Marie Curie**.
- 2014-11-15: Talked to **George Washington Carver** on the phone for an hour.
```

See the example
[`friends.md`](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends/blob/master/friends.md)
file for more information.

### Global flags

`friends` supports several global flags that can be used on any command when
specified before the name of the command, like: `friends [flags] [command]`.

These flags are:

- `--colorless`: Disable output colorization and other effects.
- `--debug`: Debug error messages with a full backtrace.
- `--filename`: Set the location of the friends file to use (default: ./friends.md).

```bash
$ friends --filename ./test/tmp/friends.md clean
File cleaned: "./test/tmp/friends.md"
```

- `--quiet`: Quiet output messages.

```bash
$ friends --quiet add activity Went rollerskating with George.
$ # No output!
```

In addition, these flags may be used without any command:

- `--help`: Show the help menu. This is equivalent to `friends help`.
Help menus are available for all levels of commands:

```bash
$ friends --help
```

```bash
$ friends list --help
```

```bash
$ friends list activities --help
```

- `--version`: Show the `friends` program version.

### Syncing across multiple machines

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to use `friends` across all of your
devices? Hooray, you can! Just put the `friends.md` file in your
Dropbox/Box Sync/Google Drive/whatever folder and use the
`--filename` flag. You can even set up a Bash/Zsh/whatever alias to
do this for you, like so:

```bash
alias friends="friends --filename '~/Dropbox/friends.md'"
```

### Command reference*

*Note that the command-line output is colored, which this README cannot show.

#### `add activity`

```bash
$ friends add activity Got lunch with Grace and George.
Activity added: "2015-01-04: Got lunch with Grace Hopper and George Washington Carver."
```

`friends` will **automatically** figure out which "Grace" and "George" you're referring to, *even if you're friends with lots of different Graces and Georges*.

Nicknames will be used to match friends in activities,
just like formal names:

```bash
$ friends add activity Invented debugging with The Admiral.
Activity added: "2016-01-06: Invented debugging with Grace Hopper."
```

You can also use the first initial of a last name instead of the whole thing.
`friends` will figure out what to do with those pesky periods (if you include
them) based on whether you're in the middle of a sentence or not:

```bash
$ friends add activity Got lunch with Earnest H and Earnest S. in the park. Man, I like Earnest H. but really love Earnest S.
Activity added: "2016-05-01: Got lunch with Earnest Hemingway and Earnest Shackleton in the park. Man, I like Earnest Hemingway but really love Earnest Shackleton."
```

And locations will be matched as well:

```bash
$ friends add activity Went swimming near atlantis with George.
Activity added: "2016-01-06: Went swimming near Atlantis with George Washington Carver."
```

Tags will be colored if they're provided (though this README can't display
color so you'll just have to have faith here):

```bash
$ friends add activity The office softball team wins a game! @work @exercise
Activity added: "2016-05-05: The office softball team wins a game! @work @exercise"
```

You can of course specify a date for the activity:

```bash
$ friends add activity Yesterday: Celebrated the new year with Marie.
Activity added: "2014-12-31: Celebrated the new year with Marie Curie."
```

Or get an **interactive prompt** by just typing `friends add activity`, with or without a date specified:

```bash
$ friends add activity 2015-11-01
2015-11-01: <type description here>
```

**Natural-language dates** work just fine:

```bash
$ friends add activity last Monday
2016-03-07: <type description here>
```

You can escape the names of friends you don't want `friends` to match with a backslash:

```bash
$ friends add activity "2015-11-01: Grace and I went to \Marie's Diner. \George had to cancel at the last minute."
Activity added: "2015-11-01: Grace Hopper and I went to Marie's Diner. George had to cancel at the last minute."
```

#### `add friend`

```bash
$ friends add friend Grace Hopper
Friend added: "Grace Hopper"
```

#### `add tag`

```bash
$ friends add tag Grace Hopper science
Tag added to friend: "Grace Hopper @science"
```

#### `add location`

```
$ friends add location Atlantis
Location added: "Atlantis"
```

#### `add nickname`

```bash
$ friends add nickname "Grace Hopper" "The Admiral"
Nickname added: "Grace Hopper (a.k.a. The Admiral)
$ friends add nickname "Grace Hopper" "Amazing Grace"
Nickname added: "Grace Hopper (a.k.a. The Admiral a.k.a. Amazing Grace)"
```

#### `clean`

Reads and re-writes the `friends.md` file:

```bash
$ friends clean
File cleaned: "./friends.md"
```

This command is useful after manual editing of the file, for re-ordering its
contents.

#### `edit`

Allows you to manually edit the file:

```bash
$ friends edit
Opening "./friends.md" in vim
```

The file is opened with the command specified by the `$EDITOR` environment
variable, falling back to `vim` if it is not set:

```bash
$ export EDITOR=atom
$ friends edit
Opening "./friends.md" in atom
```

#### `graph`

Graphs (in color!) your activities over time:

```bash
$ friends graph
Nov 2014 |███
Dec 2014 |██
Jan 2015 |███████
Feb 2015 |█████
```

Or graph only activities with a certain friend:

```bash
$ friends graph --with George
Nov 2014 |█
Dec 2014 |
Jan 2015 |█████
Feb 2015 |███
```

Or graph only activities with a certain tag:

```bash
$ friends graph --tagged food
Nov 2014 |█
Dec 2014 |
Jan 2015 |
Feb 2015 |███
```

Or graph only activities in a certain location:

```bash
$ friends graph --in Paris
Nov 2014 |█
Dec 2014 |
Jan 2015 |
Feb 2015 |█
```

Or graph only activities on or after a certain date:

```bash
$ friends graph --since 'January 1st 2015'
Jan 2015 |███████
Feb 2015 |█████
```

Or graph only activities before or on a certain date:

```bash
$ friends graph --until 'January 1st 2015'
Nov 2014 |███
Dec 2014 |██
Jan 2015 |███████
```

And you can use multiple of these flags together:

```bash
$ friends graph --in Paris --tagged food --with George --after 'September 2014'
Nov 2014 |█
```

#### `help`

Displays a help menu. This is equivalent to `friends --help`.

```bash
$ friends help

```

Or filter your activities by location:

```bash

2014-12-31: Celebrated the new year with Marie Curie in New York City. @partying
```

Or by tag:

```bash
